Maps and logo by Crow
Hosted by Thothie
the Crow2.wad is a new one. Its way smaller. If you don't have the old one,
then don't worry about it but if you do, don't replace it with this one or
else you might not be able to play my older maps. Your old one should have
all the textures needed for this.
