A map for Master Sword: Continued

Here's my third MSC map. I had seen the boss level in Titan Quest and thought
it was pretty cool. One day, I was just playing around in Hammer to see if I
could make something similar in style. At first, it wasn't supposed to become
a map but I decided to expand it and this is what it became. I felt like
making something big and outdoors, and I think it turned out pretty well.

Thanks again to Thothie for the script, J-M v2.5.5 for the testing, Sabre and
FER for the modeling, and anyone else who helped me.
