A map for Master Sword: Continued

Thanks to J-M v2.5.5, LordThraxis, Mikkel, Tao and a bunch of other people for
helping me test the map, and, of course, thanks to Thothie for the scripts,
support and a lot of playtesting. The boat (originally made by Ewok) was
decompiled from the Deralia bsp (for the sake of consistency) and
reconstructed by me. The textures were taken from the default Master Sword:
Continued wads. Music composed by me.
