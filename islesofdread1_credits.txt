Isles of Dread 1 by J
A map for Master Sword: Continued

This is my second map for MSC. Thanks to Thothie again for writing the
scripts. I've used the default MSC textures and a bunch of custom ones, many
of them slightly modified for my purposes. Here's a list of the custom
textures used as provided or as a base for new textures:

Palm leaves .......... palme.wad (http://www.cs-maps.org/)
Jungle textures ...... 3D_Mike_Junglepack.wad (http://www.cs-maps.org/)
Sand texture ......... czde_dust.wad (http://www.cs-maps.org/)
Grass texture ........ ms_generic.wad (default MSC wad)
Swamp tree texture ... mastersword.wad (default MSC wad)

I believe the skybox is Crinity's (http://crinity.planethalflife.gamespy.com/)
Tropical, though the download link on the site didn't work. Luckily, I was
able to find it in a CS map named fy_poolparty.

The boat you can see in the map was originally made for Deralia by Ewok. It
was decompiled and reconstructed by me to keep things consistent.

As for the name, I don't know who came up with it but the Isles of Dread were
marked on the MSC world map and my map seemed to be suitable to be one of
them. Turns out the Isle of Dread is some D&D thing, but this map has nothing
to do with that.
