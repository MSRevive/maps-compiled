Nashalrath, based on a story by Gurluas, was originally a 3-part map series
being developed by LittleFrodo. The development was, however, halted and the
map was put in the WIP archives. I took the sources and combined all 3 parts
to make one map, I also replaced the beginning that was directly taken
from Jester's Unrest map.
